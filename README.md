Recommendation System
In this project building a recommendation system that recommends
transcribed video content to all of the twitter topic categories.
You will select 10 Twitter users (real people, not organizations) and determine which of the
youtube transcriptions you need to feed the app for each one of them. Your recommendations will be based on their
past retweets so select people that are very active on twitter.


Used twitter api to fetch twitter data from the user. And Youtube data api to collect youtube title 
to recomend the Youtube video title based on top news topics
Here tried address the video recommendation issue by cross-platform collaboration from Twitter to YouTube.
We use YouTube as the video sharing platform to perform the recommendation task, and Twitter as the social 
textual stream platform to extract the real-time hot topics users followed.
we design a cross-platform video recommendation strategy that is generally divided into two steps:
(1) real-time hot topic detection—the hot topics that users are following currently are extracted from users’ tweets,
which are utilized to obtain the related videos on YouTube. 
 
CROSS-PLATFORM DATA ANALYSIS
In this section, we examine the characteristics of user behaviors between Twitter and YouTube. 
First, we describe how we collect our cross-platform dataset. Afterwards, in order to maintain the reliability of the data analysis, 
we manually select some widely- known hot topics that are frequently talked about both in Twitter and YouTube.
